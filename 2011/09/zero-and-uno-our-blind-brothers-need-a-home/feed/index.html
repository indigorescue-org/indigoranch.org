		<description><![CDATA[I am very impressed with your website and love seeing Zero and Uno playing.  I would love to adopt these two, but alas I have two already!  One, Meeka, is partially blind now.  We live on two acres near Gresham.  I&#039;ve often thought of developing a program like yours.  This gives me something to think about!  Thank you.  I will be keeping my eyes open and maybe someday come visit!]]></description>
