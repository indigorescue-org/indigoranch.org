                  By now some of you have learned about the eight week old
                  German Shepherd puppy I&#8217;ve been taking care of
                  round-the-clock for the past few days. Her name is Imann (like
                  the super model), but I call her Kitty, and I&#8217;ll explain
                  why, shortly.<a
                    href="http://oregoncanineuniversity.org/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2011/09/Imann-9_2_11.jpg"
                    ><br /> </a
                  ><br />
                  The shelter called me on Wednesday night because the puppy was
                  not able to keep any food down. No matter what they tried, she
                  continued to vomit everything she ate and she was getting very
                  weak. There was some vet history from a former owner showing
                  that since she was at least five weeks old she had been
                  treated for parasites and was currently on meds for coccidia,
                  but evidently they could not figure out why she continued to
                  vomit. At the time, she weighed 5lbs. And after three weeks of
                  vomiting, here&#8217;s a surprise, the owner dropped her off
                  at the shelter and conveniently failed to mention that she had
                  any medical problems.

                  I picked the puppy up on Thursday morning. She looked
                  terrible! She was so thin that I could feel all her ribs and
                  hip bones. She was so weak that she stumbled when she walked
                  and just looked generally very sad. My intention was to bring
                  her straight to our vet, but I decided to give her a bath
                  first because she had dried vomit all over her. Ugh! Poor
                  little girl.<br />
                  After her bath I took her up to the clinic. We weighed her and
                  she still weighed 5lbs (three weeks later). We ran a parvo
                  test which was negative, and a giardia test which was also
                  negative. So Dr. Mark gave her fluids and put her on some
                  pro-biotics (for intestinal support). We decided I should try
                  feeding her tiny amounts of food every hour or two. So
                  that&#8217;s what I did. I stayed up all night on Thursday
                  night and it was so frustrating! The puppy was so starving she
                  would eat a tablespoon of food ravenously, and a few minutes
                  later, up it came. Over and over. It didn&#8217;t matter what
                  I offered her, or how small the quantity. She just
                  couldn&#8217;t keep it down. She moaned and whimpered a lot
                  and I could see she was miserable because she was soooo
                  hungry, but just couldn&#8217;t fill her little tummy.

                  So Dr. Mark picked her up at 6:45am on Friday morning and took
                  her up to the clinic for an x-ray. I was sure she must have
                  had a partial obstruction (swallowed something she
                  shouldn&#8217;t have), or some kind of severe congenital
                  deformity&#8230;three hours later I hadn&#8217;t heard
                  anything so I called the clinic. Dr. Mark said he didn&#8217;t
                  know what to tell me, other than that something was
                  &#8220;very wrong&#8221;. He was able to say that her heart,
                  lungs and abdomen were &#8220;wrong&#8221;. He was stumped. He
                  told me he sent her x-rays to the radiographer at 7:30am and
                  still hadn&#8217;t heard back (he would usually have gotten a
                  report back within an hour or two), and it was apparently
                  because they wanted to consult with one another because her
                  x-rays were so confusing. Finally, they all agreed what they
                  were looking at was a congenital defect called a
                  &#8220;persistent right aortic arch&#8221; and it causes a
                  secondary condition called &#8220;mega-esophagus&#8221;. Her
                  esophagus had dilated to such an extent that it was shoving
                  all of her other organs over into a corner. The condition is
                  not common but is seen in German Shepherds and a few other
                  breeds.
                </p>
                <p>
                  This is her x-ray. The big blob that sits where her heart
                  should be, is actually her esophagus. The swirly stuff in her
                  stomach is gas because she kept trying to eat and was gulping
                  air when she vomited.<br />

                <p>
                  So now that we know what&#8217;s wrong with her, what do we
                  do?? It was late on Friday evening by the time we had a
                  diagnosis. We determined that the only way she could keep food
                  down would be to have a liquid diet (like Ensure for humans),
                  given by syringe, while holding her body upright for 10-15
                  minutes so the liquid could travel through the esophagus. She
                  needed to be fed small amounts every two hours. So the clinic
                  called around and found the liquid diet she needed at the
                  emergency vet clinic in Tanasbourne and I raced over and
                  picked it up just before 9pm. Then I raced over to Bethany and
                  picked up the puppy, and got ready for my second night
                  attempting to get the puppy to keep food down. It worked! I
                  fed her tiny amounts by syringe, while hanging her little body
                  in the air from my arm. She kept it down. Each time I fed her
                  she was stronger and more ravenous. It was so exciting to
                  witness! Finally, that tiny body was getting some nourishment.

                  By Sunday, she was already able to take much more of the
                  liquid food, had been able to go to the bathroom, and was
                  acting almost like a normal puppy! I continue to hold her with
                  her little legs dangling in the air for 15 minutes and she has
                  not vomited once! I nicknamed her Kitty because the minute I
                  put her down, she pees and comes over to rub against my legs,
                  just like a cat! She also makes these funny sounds while
                  she&#8217;s digesting her food and it sounds like a cat
                  meowing.

                  So, Imann (Kitty), is scheduled for surgery on Wednesday
                  morning. Two vets will try to remove the band of tissue that
                  caused the mega-esophagus. Her prognosis is guarded. They told
                  me she may not survive the surgery, but also, her esophagus
                  may never return to normal size. Apparently people have built
                  special chairs for adult dogs with this condition, so they can
                  eat while upright and stay that way long enough for the food
                  to make it through their esophagus. Obviously, we&#8217;d
                  prefer that this little girl gets to eat like a normal dog,
                  but we&#8217;ll take that one step at a time. For now, you
                  should know that she&#8217;s such an amazingly sweet girl! She
                  is incredibly tolerant and very good natured in spite of her
                  obvious discomfort.<br />
                  In the spirit of the tag from the bottom of my emails, Kitty
                  is an example of what we always want to be able to do as
                  Indigo Rescue; never, never, never give up. For us, it&#8217;s
                  not as much about the volume, it&#8217;s about going the extra
                  mile for some of the ones who need a little extra care.

                  If you are able to donate toward Kitty&#8217;s surgery we
                  would be very grateful. We are not sure yet how much it will
                  cost, but we know it won&#8217;t be cheap. It&#8217;s always
                  hard on us when we get a rescue that needs an expensive
                  surgery because we want to do everything we can for them even
                  during financially challenging times. They don&#8217;t know
                  our economy isn&#8217;t great, just that they need our help!
                  Please feel free to cross-post to your friends or anyone you
                  believe may be able to contribute, too. All donations are
                  tax-deductible. You can send a check and write
                  &#8220;Kitty&#8221; in the memo (Indigo Rescue PO Box 554
                  Beaverton, Oregon), or you can make a donation on Paypal using

                </p>
                <p>
                  I will keep you all posted after Kitty has surgery on
                  Wednesday.
