                <p>
                  Our regular group of dedicated volunteers plus a couple of
                  newbies, met up today at the Beaverton Petsmart so we could
                  show some of our great rescued dogs who are available for
                  adoption. We meet every other Saturday at Petsmart from noon
                  to 4pm. All things considered, everyone was pretty well
                  behaved (I&#8217;m referring to the dogs, of course).
                </p>
                <p>
                  We got a couple of good applications and sent people home to
                  think about whether they are up for the commitment of adopting
                  one of our dogs. The last thing we want to do is send a dog
                  home with someone sho is reactionary and smitten with the look
                  of a dog. It&#8217;s far too important of decision than that!
                </p>
                <p>
                  So, Kenai, Vince, Tawnee and Elwood all got applications.
                  Fingers crossed for some really good adoptions!

                <p>
                  Second, she&#8217;s having a bad day today. She started
                  vomiting and coughing this morning so we ran a parvo
                  test&#8230;and it was negative (whew!) but she does have
                  kennel cough, so we&#8217;re giving her some Pepcid for her
                  upset stomach, and cherry flavored Umcka for the kennel cough.
                  Dr. Mark took another set of x-rays, and said the break is so
                  bad and her little bones are so small, that it will be best to
                  see if it will heal on its own as an &#8220;unaligned
                  fracture&#8221;. We&#8217;ll wait three weeks and check it out
                  again.

                  We finally got the results from the spinal fluid sample from
                  Elijah Blu. There is good news and there is bad news. The good
                  news is that Elijah&#8217;s condition is not surgical and he
                  does not have any inflammatory process going on. So he
                  won&#8217;t need surgery and he won&#8217;t need to take meds
                  for the rest of his life.
                </p>
                <p>
                  The bad news is that Dr. Skinner believes that Elijah Blu had
                  a hemmorhage in his spinal cord at some point. This happens in
                  3-5% of dogs and they do not know why or what causes it. The
                  outcome is permanent damage, although they generally improve
                  some over a period of 3-6 months following the incident. We
                  don&#8217;t know how long ago this may have happened to Elijah
                  so we don&#8217;t know whether he has already been through
                  that time period, but we have decided the fight isn&#8217;t
                  over yet! We want to get Elijah Blu as close as we can to
                  walking and playing like a normal dog. Now we are going to try
                  a laser treatment that replicates acupuncture without the
                  needles.
                </p>
                <p>
                  Elijah&#8217;s laser treatment will begin next Monday and will
                  go a few times per week for three to four weeks. We will, of
                  course, keep you all up to date on his progress&#8230;

                  Can you believe it?! He had his second spinal tap on Monday

                  Everyone who deals with us on a regular basis knows that we
                  don&#8217;t get very many puppies in rescue. For one thing, we
                  are here to help the dogs who aren&#8217;t going to otherwise
                  have a chance at getting a new home, and puppies generally fly
                  off the shelf (so to speak).

                  An example of a special circumstance where we might get a
                  puppy, is when they come in with medical issues, such as
                  broken bones. Last week we got the little
                  &#8220;Trooper&#8221; with a broken front left leg, and
                  tonight we got&#8230;

                  Another broken little Chihuahua puppy. This little guy is
                  probably 12 weeks old, and weighs a whopping 3lbs. He has the
                  same broken front left leg, but his leg is broken worse than
                  Trooper&#8217;s, and may need surgery to place pins and try to
                  hold the bones together.

                  I swear these little guys get stepped on by their owners, who
                  can&#8217;t afford or don&#8217;t want to pay a vet bill, so
                  they drop them off at the shelter. Seriously, this guy was
                  supposedly a stray&#8230;really? I&#8217;m kinda doubting it.

                  And before you all start emailing me about wanting to adopt
                  him, here&#8217;s an icky thing we&#8217;ve already discovered
                  about the little guy. He eats his own poop, and tries really
                  hard to get a sneak kiss in by shooting his tongue in your
                  mouth french kiss style. Oy! ;o )
                </p>
                <p>
                  We&#8217;ve also figured out he&#8217;s got a pretty good set
                  of lungs on him and does NOT want you to leave him alone. He
                  sounds like a dying duck. Okay, all of that aside, he&#8217;s
                  still the cutest, tiny little guy, who just wants to be held.
                  We&#8217;ll have Dr Mark decide about surgery tomorrow. More
                  details to follow.

                  I picked the little Min Pin up at the shelter today and just
                  dropped the little guy off at his new foster home tonight and
                  he did great! He was instantly friendly and playful with their
                  two little Chihuahua&#8217;s and raced around with them,
                  leaping up on the sofa then off the sofa, then on to the
                  foster&#8217;s lap, then on to my lap! Absolutely gleeful, and
                  finally settling in for a rest&#8230;

                  My hope is that his history of re-direct biting has been based
                  on fearful behavior that wasn&#8217;t managed by a very savvy
                  person. I believe he&#8217;s just a sensitive guy who needs
                  people to respect his boundaries. We&#8217;ll share more as we
                  learn about him, but for now, he&#8217;s sure glad to be free
                  and a very happy guy. Good for him!

                  There&#8217;s a description of fostering for Indigo Rescue
                  posted on the Indigo website under Volunteer. Ask any of our
                  diehard fosters, who have fostered many, many dogs for us, and
                  they will tell you, fostering isn&#8217;t easy, but it sure
                  can be rewarding knowing that your part in providing a foster
                  home is what saves a dogs life.
                </p>
                <p>
                  We have successfully placed Raven the Rottie, and the little
                  Min Pin (later today)  into foster homes, but Jada, the
                  beautiful Black Lab/Boxer mix, and the little Eskie-Pom mix,
                  Shasta, still need somewhere to go, and there are several more
                  dogs we are working on finding fosters for. First in line are
                  two new dogs who need to find a foster home!  These two are
                  three year old siblings, a boy and a girl. They&#8217;re Wire
                  Haired Dachshunds. These are their shelter pics so they
                  aren&#8217;t great, but you can tell they&#8217;re really cute
                  dogs. The shelter say&#8217;s they&#8217;re sweet but shy,
                  moreso the female than the male&#8230;
                </p>
                <p>
                  Help! Lets give these guys a chance to recover from the fear
                  and trauma of whatever tragic history they have had, so they
                  can find a new home. Meet Muriel and Devon!

                  We decided to name the little broken Miniature Pinscher, or
                  Dachshund/Chihuahua or whatever he is, Trooper. Cuz
                  that&#8217;s definitely what he is! This little guy truly
                  doesn&#8217;t ever feel sorry for himself! He just marches on
                  as if he doesn&#8217;t have a badly broken leg and a HUGE
                  cast! Here he is today with his new cast, complete with a cute
                  little bandaid Perry made for him : o )

                  I deliberated over whether it was a good idea to share some of
                  my personal loss on the blog, but in the spirit of sharing
                  what it&#8217;s like to live the life of animal rescue, it
                  seemed appropriate to share more than just the actual Indigo

                  The following is an obituary of sorts. I wrote it as part of
                  my own healing and to help me find closure:
                </p>
                <p>
                  I lost my 20 year old kitty, Schautzie on Saturday
                  night/Sunday morning.<br />
                  <img
                    class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-999"
                    title="schautzie"
                    src="http://oregoncanineuniversity.org/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2010/10/schautzie.jpg"

                    height="487"
                  /><br />
                  Schautzie was my first rescue following moving to Oregon. He
                  and an identical sibling who another neighbor adopted, were
                  abandoned in the apartment complex I was living in. We
                  estimated they were six months old.
                </p>
                <p>
                  He was such a good natured kitty. He never hissed or grumbled
                  at any of the other cats, just did his own thing and sorta
                  rolled with the punches&#8230;and there were a lot of those.
                  After all, the cats who live with me see a lot of canine and
                  feline traffic, and that can be really hard on a cat.
                </p>
                <p>
                  When I bought my first home, Schautzie was in heaven because
                  he could go outside. I installed Cat fencing to keep everyone
                  in my backyard and safe, but Schautzie enjoyed his
                  independence and wanted to be out in front of my house in his
                  own kingdom, and he never did wander past my driveway, so I
                  allowed it. He was the only one I allowed to go out the front
                  door, rather than the back.<br />

                  Over the past few years, the only age related issue Schautzie
                  developed was some arthritis in his rear legs. He would limp a
                  little, but never, ever missed a meal. He loved to eat! I had
                  started having his long hair shaved for the summer, because he
                  didn&#8217;t do much grooming any longer and his hair would
                  get mattes.

                  On Saturday, when I returned from our tag sale, Schautzie was
                  hiding in a cat house (like a dogloo) and cried out for me. I
                  found him and he was already failing to the point where I knew
                  he was in grave condition. He had been fine and wandering
                  around the yard two days before, so the failing part happened
                  really quickly.
                </p>
                <p>
                  I warmed him up with heat lamps and a heating pad, gave him
                  sub q fluids (under the skin), gave him some water with
                  colloidal silver (anti-viral) orally to wet his throat, gave
                  him pain meds, Rescue Remedy and antibiotics, and hoped for
                  the best.
                </p>
                <p>
                  I could tell he was feeling better as he warmed up because he
                  was stretching his arms out and responsive to all of the
                  things I did for him, but he was so weak, I knew he just
                  needed to rest. I asked him not to purr (which he did
                  constantly) because it took too much energy.
                </p>
                <p>
                  I spoke with Dr Mark and we agreed there was nothing more I
                  could do for him. I checked on him every hour so I could
                  monitor his temperature and at 1:45am when I checked on him,
                  he seemed restless and was moving around, but I quickly
                  realized he was dying. I sat with him and reassured him and he
                  died quietly within the next two minutes. He did not appear to
                  be suffering at all.

                  The first picture is Schautzie from about 1998. The second was
                  taken in 2007 (Schautzie loved to sunbathe). The last picture 
                  is from August of this year. You can&#8217;t miss those
                  beautiful eyes. Schautzie was with me for 19.5 years of my
                  life. It&#8217;s a long, long time. The entire time I have
                  lived in Oregon. My life has changed a lot over those years
                  and Schautzie was a constant. I will miss his sweet face and
                  bright green eyes, but mostly, his sweet demeanor&#8230;

                  I picked up the mail today, and there was a donation from
                  someone who learned about us in the Oregonian. The envelope
                  was hand written with a postmark from Pacific City. There was
                  a cashiers check for $1000 enclosed, along with a hand written
                  note, below
                </p>
                <p>THANK YOU!:</p>
