                <p>
                  So last night I let the dogs out for a last pee around 10pm. I
                  was looking forward to going to bed early because I
                  hadn&#8217;t been getting much sleep with the two puppies. The
                  dogs were outside for less than ten minutes.
                </p>
                <p>
                  I opened the door and everyone came in as expected, except for
                  little Zamora, a cute little fluffy black and tan mixed small
                  dog. I wasn&#8217;t too alarmed initially because sometimes
                  Zamora likes to hang back and trail in last, after she&#8217;s
                  had a few more romps around the yard.
                </p>
                <p>
                  After a few minutes, I opened the door and called for her, but
                  she was nowhere in sight. I grabbed my flashlight and went out
                  in the yard and started poking around. This wouldn&#8217;t be
                  too big of deal, except that my yard is .5 acre with lots of
                  trees and shrubs, and it was pitch black and really cold!!
                </p>
                <p>
                  I called my friend Diane while I walked around seaching the
                  yard with my flashlight and told her I was worried that Zamora
                  hadn&#8217;t come in with the other dogs because she almost
                  never wants to be away from Maybelle. I stood still and
                  listened to see if she was moving around, but heard nothing.
                </p>
                <p>
                  <img
                    class="alignright size-full wp-image-930"

                  />
                </p>
                <p>
                  After more than half an hour of poking around my yard with the
                  flashlight and two other dogs, I started walking the fence
                  line. I couldn&#8217;t believe there was any area she could
                  get through!
                </p>
                <p>
                  I eventually wound up behind my shed and realized there was a
                  small gap along the bottom of the chain link where the earth
                  had eroded away and at least my boot could fit through. But
                  could Zamora fit through?
                </p>
                <p>
                  By now I was convinced she was not anywhere in the yard, so
                  she had to have somehow gotten out. PANIC! It was nearly an
                  hour since I had let the dogs back in and realized she had
                  disappeared. This is a little black dog missing in the pitch
                  black and cold, late on a Saturday night!
                </p>
                <p>
                  I quickly jumped in the car and drove to the neighborhood
                  behind mine so I could see if maybe she was stuck in the yard
                  of the house behind mine. I realized as soon as I got there
                  that they have a huge gap at the bottom of their gate, and she
                  could have easily gotten through there and kept going&#8230;it
                  was now 11:30pm. No!!
                </p>
                <p>
                  I drove around and around the neighborhood looking for her
                  until just before midnight, and all the while my friend Diane
                  had stayed on the phone with me.
                </p>
                <p>
                  Diane finally convinced me to go home and try to get some
                  sleep so I could get up early and start searching again. I
                  felt sick with worry, but agreed I couldn&#8217;t do anything
                  more in the dark.
                </p>
                <p>
                  I went ahead and called the sheriffs department and reported
                  Zamora as a lost dog just in case they got a call from someone
                  about a found dog (they have access to the kennels at the
                  county shelter for after hours stray dog drop-offs).
                </p>
                <p>
                  I clung to the hope that I would come home and somehow find
                  her in the yard waiting for me, but unfortunately, she was
                  still nowhere in sight. It was a very surreal experience. You
                  can&#8217;t believe they could really be gone so you keep
                  checking, but they definitely aren&#8217;t there and your
                  heart sinks every time. Still, I went to bed and kept the
                  light on the porch on just in case she somehow made her way
                  back.
                </p>
                <p>
                  I finally slept for about three hours, then got up at 5am so I
                  could make flyers. I went through my backyard in the dark
                  again, then made a LOST DOG flyer with a picture of Zamora,
                  and drove around in the dark hanging them on posts and at
                  every place where you can enter or exit the neighborhoods.
                </p>
                <p>
                  My hope was that as soon as people were up and leaving home,
                  they&#8217;d see my flyer and hopefully have seen Zamora, too.
                  I hung flyers in my neighborhood, too, just in case
                  she&#8217;d figured out how to get back into my yard from
                  someone&#8217;s backyard in the other neighborhood.
                </p>
                <p>
                  By a little after 7am, at sun-up I was done. I took one more
                  slow drive around the two neighborhoods and then went home to
                  wait and see if someone would call.
                </p>
                <p>
                  At 7:40am I got home, and on auto-pilot I walked back to check
                  my yard one more time. I opened the door, and what do you
                  think? There was Zamora walking toward me with a sheepish
                  &#8220;Am I in trouble?&#8221; look. I looked back at her in
                  disbelief. Seriously?! Were you hiding in the yard the entire
                  night, or did you get out and come back?
                </p>
                <p>
                  It was freaking 34 degrees outside and she&#8217;d been gone
                  nearly ten hours! I reminded myself that I had told myself
                  during the numerous loops I&#8217;d made around the
                  neighborhood looking for her, that as frustrated as I was, if
                  I found her alive I would be so grateful that I wouldn&#8217;t
                  be mad at her.
                </p>
                <p>
                  I scooped her up and she gave me a few chilly licks. Poor
                  little girl was cold! Brrrrrr. I have NO idea what in the hell
                  was going through her little head when she pulled that prank,
                  but she definitely lost her off-leash-in-the-yard rights, at
                  least at night. I also pulled a railroad tie and three cinder
                  blocks over and blocked the weak area at the bottom of my
                  fence. I definitely rained on her parade!
                </p>
                <p>
                  Sigh&#8230;I got back in the car and drove around pulling down
                  all of my flyers and walked around in a bit of a coma today,
                  but I guess all&#8217;s well that ends well&#8230;little
                  angel.
